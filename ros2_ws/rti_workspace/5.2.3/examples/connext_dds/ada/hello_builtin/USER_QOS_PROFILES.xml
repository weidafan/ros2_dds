Description
An RTI Connext QoS Profile that provides high throughput
for streaming reliable data.

This profile depends primarily on:

Data writer:
  - batch:    combining multiple samples into a single network packet to
              increase throughput
  - protocol: send heartbeats to readers more frequently to cache levels low

Data reader:
  - protocol: respond more aggressively to heartbeats with positive or
              negative acknowledgements to speed up repairs of lost packets

Domain participant:
  - Increased transport buffer sizes to efficiently send and receive many
    large packets

        The HighThroughput profile is an extension of the Reliable profile.
        RTI Connext provides APIs for loading multiple QoS

        the sake of simplicity, we duplicate the Reliable profile here. For

                            buffer size. This will allow you to receive
                            multiple large packets without UDP receive errors.

                            a larger value will fail silently; the value will
                            be set to the maximum allowed by that policy.
