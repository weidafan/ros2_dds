Welcome to Connext.


Compiling this Example
----------------------

Before compiling make sure that the environment variable NDDSHOME is defined 
and that it refers to your RTI Connext installation directory. 

To build this example on Windows, open the appropriate solution file for your
version of Microsoft Visual Studio in the win32/ directory.

To build this example on a UNIX-based system, type the following in a command
shell:

  > gmake -f make/Makefile.<architecture>


Running this Example
--------------------
This example is composed of two applications: a requester and a replier.

To run this example on Windows, type the following in two different command
shells, either on the same machine or on different machines:

  > objs\<architecture>\PrimeNumberReplier [<domain_id>]
  > objs\<architecture>\PrimeNumberRequester <n> [<primes_per_reply> [<domain_id>]]

To run this example on a UNIX-based system, type the following in two
different command shells, either on the same machine or on different machines:

  > objs/<architecture>/PrimeNumberReplier [<domain_id>]
  > objs/<architecture>/PrimeNumberRequester <n> [<primes_per_reply> [<domain_id>]]

The Requester and the Replier are configured by the file USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml
located in this directory. You can modify this file to change the example's
behavior.

For more information on using Requesters and Repliers, 
please consult the RTI Core Libraries and Utilities 
Getting Started Guide and User's Manual.
