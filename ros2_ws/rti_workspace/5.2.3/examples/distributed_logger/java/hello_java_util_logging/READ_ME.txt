RTI Distributed Logger
Hello_java_util_logging Example Application
======================================

Welcome to RTI Distributed Logger.

Set Up the Environment
----------------------

There are a few things to take care of before you start 
working with the example code. 

1) Set the NDDSHOME environment variable

   Set the environment variable NDDSHOME to the RTI Connext 
   installation directory. For more information, see the RTI  
   Connext Core Libraries and Utilities Getting Started Guide.

2) Set the RTI_EXAMPLE_ARCH environment variable

   Set the environment variable RTI_EXAMPLE_ARCH to your system 
   architecture. Architectures are listed in both the RTI Connext 
   Core Libraries and Utilities Release Notes and Platform Notes 
   PDF documents.
   
   Example: RTI_EXAMPLE_ARCH=i86Win32VS2012

3) Ensure that both javac and java are available on your PATH.

Compiling this Example
----------------------

To build this example on a Windows system, type the following 
in a command shell:

  > build

To build this example on a UNIX-based system, type the following 
in a command shell:

  > ./build.sh


To build this example for the Jamaica JVM on VxWorks:

* Ensure the environment for Vxworks and Jamaica is setup:

  * The JAMAICA environment variable should point to your Jamaica installation

example for Vxworks 6.7 kernel-mode:

export JAMAICA=/var/jamaica-6.2-1_vxworks-ppc6xx-be-dkm-6.7

  * The TARGETPLATFORM environment variable should point to a directory
    that exists under $JAMAICA/target/

example for VxWorks 6.7 kernel-mode:

export TARGETPLATFORM=vxworks-ppc6xx-be

  * Ensure that the RTI_EXAMPLE_ARCH environment variable is set

example for Vxworks 6.7 kernel-mode:

export RTI_EXAMPLE_ARCH=ppc604Vx6.7gcc4.1.2


* run the following command from the host that will cross-compile:

./jamaica_build.sh

* To run the subscriber on the target:

  -> cd "/NDDSHOME/lib/<architecture>"
  -> ld 1< libnddscore.so
  -> ld 1< libnddsc.so
  -> cd "/NDDSHOME/example/JAVA/Distributed_Logger/Hello_java_util_logging"
  -> ld 1< com.rti.hello.Hello
  -> taskSpawn "DL_Test",255, 0x8, 150000, jvm_com_rti_hello_Hello, "sub"



About this Example
------------------

This example application shows how to use the Distributed Logger as an 
integrated component of a logging system. In this example, the Distributed
Logger is integrated with the java.util.logging package. The integration 
is done through the configuration file logger.properties. This file 
configures RTI Distributed Logger and attaches it as a log message handler.

It is important to note that there are very few application code changes 
needed to do this integration. There's a call to DistLogger.delete() 
when the application is prepared to do a proper shutdown. That's the 
only change.

Please note that the Distributed Logger configuration specifies a QoS 
library and profile to be used. This is done because the example changes 
RTI's default QoS and this new QoS is not compatible with the QoS used by 
our other products out of the box. The specified configuration addresses
this situation for Distributed Logger's DDS entities.


Running this Example
--------------------

This example application is configured by the file USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml,
located in this directory. You can modify this file to change the 
example's behavior, however, please retain the DistributedLoggerLibrary 
library and the DistributedLoggerProfile profile. This library/profile 
is used to configure Distributed Logger's DDS entities.

To see the log message, you can run RTI Monitor and join domain 0. 
From there, open the Distributed Logger panel and select your process 
from the Physical View. You will see the log message and be able to control 
Distributed Logger's setting from that panel.

To run this example on a Windows system, type the following in two 
different command shells, either on the same machine or different machines:

  > run sub
  > run pub

To run this example on a UNIX-based system, type the following in two
different command shells, either on the same machine or different machines:

  > ./run.sh sub
  > ./run.sh pub
