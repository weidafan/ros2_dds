    Admin Console provides basic administration capabilities for Replay
    Service. You can enable, disable, pause, resume, and shutdown Replay
    Service remotely. Note that to request the service to shutdown, it must be
    idle (paused). Admin Console also displays the distributed logs from 
    Replay Service. To setup Replay Service for Admin Console, verify 
    administration and Distributed Logging is enabled in the Replay Service.
