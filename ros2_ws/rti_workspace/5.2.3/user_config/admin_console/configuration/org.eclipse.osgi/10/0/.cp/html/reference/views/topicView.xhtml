	<div class="docPageTitle">Topic View</div>

	<div class="docSectionContent">The Topic View is a user
		interface focused on information about a single DDS Topic. It has four
		tabs: Match Graph, Topic Data, Endpoints Table, and Datatypes.</div>


	<br />
	<div class="docSectionTitle">Match Graph</div>

	<div class="docScreenShot">
		<img src="../../images/topicView_matchGraph.png" />
	</div>

	<div class="docSectionContent">The Match Graph is a graphical
		view of topic. Its main purpose is to convey the match status of the
		endpoints associated with the topic in a simple, easy to digest
		format.</div>

	<div class="docSectionContent">
		At the center of the display is the topic itself. Radiating out from
		the topic are the associated endpoints. Each endpoint can have one of
		three match statuses: matched (displayed as a black line with no
		text), partially matched (a yellow line with text), and not matched (a
		red line with text). If a DataReader or DataWriter (an endpoint) fully
		matches its opposing endpoint type for the topic, it is matched. If an
		endpoint matches some but not all of its opposing endpoint type, it is
		partially matched. If an endpoint doesn't match any of its opposing
		endpoint type, it is not matched. Clicking on an endpoint will select
		it and will trigger other displays to show information about that
		endpoint (for example, the <a href="../views/ddsDataTypeView.xhtml">DDS
			Data Type</a>, <a href="../views/ddsQosView.xhtml">DDS QoS</a>, and <a
			href="../views/matchAnalysesView.xhtml">Match Analyses</a> views).
	</div>


	<br />
	<div class="docSectionTitle">Topic Data</div>
	<div class="docSectionContent">
		This tab provides the ability to subscribe to and visualize data from
		the DDS system. See the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/com.rti.tools.console.visualization/html/toc.html">Data
			Visualization</a> section for help.
	</div>


	<br />
	<div class="docSectionTitle">Endpoints Table</div>

	<div class="docScreenShot">
		<img src="../../images/topicView_endpointsTable.png" />
	</div>

	<div class="docSectionContent">
		The Endpoints Table details the DataReaders <img
			src="../../../branding/icons/datareader.png" /> and DataWriters <img
			src="../../../branding/icons/datawriter.png" /> associated with a
		single DDS Topic. Each endpoint is displayed in a single row along
		with the host and process which contain it. The Instance Handle is
		also displayed which can be useful as it relates to locating exactly
		which DataWriter wrote a particular sample (e.g. when inspecting data
		from a sample in the Sample Inspector).
	</div>


	<br />
	<div class="docSectionTitle">Datatypes</div>

	<div class="docScreenShot">
		<img src="../../images/topicView_datatypes.png" />
	</div>

	<div class="docSectionContent">
		This tab display a hierarchical view of the data types and endpoints
		associated with this topic. The tree begins at the top with the topic
		<img src="../../../branding/icons/domaintopic.png" /> itself. Below
		that are type name nodes <img
			src="../../../branding/icons/datatype.png" />. These nodes simply
		represent name of the type as it was registered with the DDS API.
		Below the type name nodes are data type <img
			src="../../../branding/icons/datatype.png" /> nodes (they currently
		use the same icon). These nodes will trigger the <a
			href="../views/ddsDataTypeView.xhtml">DDS Data Type</a> view to
		display their type information. Below the type nodes are DataReaders <img
			src="../../../branding/icons/datareader.png" /> and DataWriters <img
			src="../../../branding/icons/datawriter.png" /> which use that data
		type.
	</div>

	<div class="docSectionContent">The Max Serialized Size column
		shows the maximum size, in bytes, required to serialize the associated
		object.</div>

	<div class="docSectionContent">The Datatypes view is most useful
		when trying to debug the types used in a distributed system. It is
		often hard to keep track of who&apos;s using which type in a large
		system so this view provides a convenient way to discover the types in
		use and to see if there are match problems perhaps due to conflicting
		types.</div>
