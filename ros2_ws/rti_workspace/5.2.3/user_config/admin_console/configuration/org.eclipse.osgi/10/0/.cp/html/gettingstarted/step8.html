	<div class="docSectionContent">Admin Console is built on top of
		the Eclipse framework, which is very flexible and allows you to change
		the layout. The following provides some useful tips and tricks on how
		to customize your layout.</div>

	<br />
	<br />
	<div class="docSectionTitle">Docking:</div>
	<div class="docSectionContent">
		You can redock most tabs in Admin Console. Simply click and hold
		onto a tab, then drag it to the top, left, right, or bottom. A black
		rectangle should appear, signaling you can dock to that area. <br /> <br />

		<br /> Once you see the dotted box, you can release the mouse and the
		view will be docked to the desired area. Redocking is most useful when
		you want to see multiple things at the same time. The following shows
		a few different views. <br />

	<div class="docSectionTitle">Maximizing a view:</div>
	<div class="docSectionContent">
		Some views, such has the Distributed Log view or the Service
		Configuration view, have a lot of content that could use more screen
		space. To maximize space for that view, simply double-click on the
		tab. You can restore the original state by double-clicking on the tab
		again. <br />
