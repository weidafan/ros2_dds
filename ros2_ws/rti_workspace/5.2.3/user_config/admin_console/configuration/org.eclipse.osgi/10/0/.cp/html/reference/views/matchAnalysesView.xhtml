		The match analyses view presents a hierarchical view of one or more
		match analyses for the selected entity. Currently, match analysis is
		performed by matching quality of service (QoS) values for DataReaders
		and Data Writers as well as for DomainParticipants using transport
		settings.

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name</strong> - The name of entity to which the
				selected entity is being compared or the name of the match criterion
				for this row. If the row is highlighted as a link, clicking on it
				will open a web page with a more detailed description of the
				matching rules (Note: this feature requires a connection to the
				internet as the web pages are retrieved from RTI's Community
				Portal).</li>

			<li><strong>Offered</strong> - The value supplied by the
				DataWriter or DomainParticipant for the match criterion.</li>

			<li><strong>Requested</strong> - The value supplied by the
				DataReader or DomainParticipant for the match criterion.</li>

			<li><strong>Notes</strong> - This cell indicates the state
				(Mismatched or OK) as well as further details about the match
				criterion.</li>
		</ul>

		The toolbar in this view contains controls to:
		<ul>
			<li><img src="../../../branding/icons/matchcriterion.png" />
				Toggle this button to show/hide mismatches from the view. When
				unselected (the default), both mismatches and matches are displayed
				in the view. If selected, then only mismatched entries are
				displayed. Note that changes to this setting will be preserved and
				restored the next time the Admin Console is run.</li>

			<li><img src="../../../branding/icons/tree_expand_all.gif" />
				Expand all tree nodes.</li>

			<li><img src="../../../branding/icons/tree_collapse_all.gif" />
				Collapse all tree nodes.</li>

			<li><img
				src="PLUGINS_ROOT/com.rti.tools.console.utils/icons/connected.png" />
				Link with selection - Toggling this button will link/unlink this
				view to/from displaying information about the current selection. One
				way to use this feature is to select something and then unlink this
				view from the selection. Then, a new instance of this view can be
				created and a populated with a new selection. Data can then be
				compared between the first and second selection.</li>

			<li>Minimize and maximize the view.</li>
