		Click on the configuration buton. This will open the current
		configuration for Routing Service. Browse around the file and you will
		see that this configuration routes various shapes from domain 0 to
		domain 1. In the configuration page, you can choose between the
		&quot;Design&quot; view and the &quot;Source&quot; view through the tabs
		in the lower left corner.

		<br /> Routing service should already be running. Follow the steps
		below to see Routing Service in action.

		<ul type="i">
			<li>Publish Squares on Domain 0: <br />
			<br /> From Step 1 of the tutorial, you should already have two
				instances of Shapes Demo: one using domain 0 and one using domain 1.
				In the Shapes Demo instance that uses domain 0, publish squares. We
				will call this the Publishing Demo. <br />
			<br /> <img src="../images/tut3_pubSquare.png" /> <br />
			<li>Subscribe to Squares on Domain 1: <br />
			<br /> In the Shapes Demo instance that uses domain 1, subscribe to
				squares. We will call this the Subscribing Demo. <br />
			<br /> <img src="../images/tut3_subSquare.png" /> <br /> Now you
				should see the squares published in domain 0 appear in domain 1,
				because Routing Service is routing the data from domain 0 to domain
				1. <br />

	<div class="docSectionContent">
		Now try to pause Routing Service. You should see the squares in the
		Subscribing Demo (using domain 1) pause. <br />

	<div class="docSectionContent">
		The Pause button will toggle into the Resume button. Click on Resume,
		and the shapes in the Subscribing Demo should appear again. <br />
