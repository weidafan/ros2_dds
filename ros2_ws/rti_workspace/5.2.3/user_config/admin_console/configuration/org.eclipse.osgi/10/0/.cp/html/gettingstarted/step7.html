	<div class="docSectionContent">Admin Console provides insight and details

    <div class="docSectionTitle">Topic View:</div>
    <div class="docSectionContent">
        The <a href="../reference/views/topicView.xhtml">Topic View</a>
        provides three distinct sets of information relating to a single DDS
        Topic in the distributed system. To best understand this information,
        let&apos;s first create a new instances of the Shapes Demo. Follow the
        same directions as in Step 3 but this time, choose the &quot;Shape&quot;
        Data Type rather than &quot;Shape Extended.&quot;
        
        <br /><br />
        <img src="../images/tut7_ShapesConfigDialog.png" />
        <br /><br />
        
        This time, let&apos;s create an orange square with exclusive ownership.
        
        <br /><br />
        <img src="../images/tut7_ShapesSquarePub.png" />
        <br /><br />
        
        From the <a href="../reference/views/ddsLogicalView.xhtml">DDS Logical 
        View</a>, select the &quot;Square&quot; Topic under &quot;Domain 
        1.&quot; The Topic View is now displaying the Endpoints Table.
        
        <br />
        <br /><img src="../images/tut7_Endpoints.png" />
        <br />
        <br />
        
        All of the DataWriters and DataReaders associated with this topic can
        now be seen in the the Endpoints Table tab. This table shows the host 
        and process that contains the endpoint. These two facts alone are often
        very helpful in understanding what is running where. When you select 
        rows from this table, you will get detailed information about the data
        type, QoS, and match status of the endpoint.
        
        Select the DataWriter associated with the Shapes Demo (use the icon 
        <img src="../../branding/icons/datawriter.png"/> in the Endpoint column
        and the process name from the Process column to find it). Now, you can
        see the data type associated with this DataWriter in the <a 
        href="../reference/views/ddsDataTypeView.xhtml">DDS Data Type View</a>.
        
        <br /><br />
        <img src="../images/tut7_ShapeType.png" />
        <br /><br />
        
        Select the DataReader associated with the Shapes Demo created earlier.
        Notice that the DDS Data Type view changes and now has this content:
        
        <br /><br />
        <img src="../images/tut7_ShapeTypeExtended.png" />
        <br /><br />
        
        This reveals that the system has multiple type definitions for the same
        Topic. This is often a critical piece of information, so much so that 
        another tab in this editor is dedicated to making this information easy
        to find. Select the &quot;Datatypes&quot; tab from the bottom right of
        the Topic View.
        
        <br /><br />
        <img src="../images/tut7_Datatypes.png" />
        <br /><br />
        
        This tab shows which endpoint is associated with each of the two 
        datatypes currently being used in the system for this Topic. It also
        shows the serialized TypeCode and sample size for each of the two
        datatypes. This information is important when tuning DDS QoS. Select the
        DataWriter listed under the &quot;ShapeType&quot; datatype. Now click on
        the <a href="../reference/views/ddsQosView.xhtml">DDS QoS View</a>.
        
        <br /><br />
        <img src="../images/tut7_ddsQoSView.png" />
        <br /><br />
        
        Want to find out more information about a particular QoS? Click on a
        hyperlinked row in the QoS Name column and the documentation for that
        QoS will be displayed (active internet connection required).
        
        <br /><br />
        The exclusive ownership setting can be seen right at the bottom of the
        DDS QoS View. This setting, however, is in conflict with the 
        previously-created DataReader. How can this be debugged? Select the 
        Match Graph tab in the Topic View.
        
        <br /><br />
        <img src="../images/tut7_MatchGraph.png" />
        <br /><br />
        
        This tab shows that the newly-created DataWriter with exclusive 
        ownership is not matched to any DataReader associated with this Topic.
        This tab can also be used to drive other displays by selecting 
        endpoints. But why does the Shapes Demo DataReader show that it is
        partially matched? Go ahead and select it and then turn your attention
        to the <a href="../reference/views/matchAnalysesView.xhtml">Match 
        Analyses View</a>.
        
        <br /><br />
        <img src="../images/tut7_MatchAnalysesMismatch.png" />
        <br /><br />
        
        The Match Analyses view provides a comprehensive view into each match
        analysis criterion as it pertains to each potential match for an entity
        in the system. In our case, the mismatched ownership QoS is obvious.
        But how can we see all of the criteria being checked in the match
        analysis? Go to the view&apos;s menu (
        <img src="../images/viewmenu.png"/> in the upper-right corner of the 
        view). Select the menu item &quot;Show only mismatches&quot; to deselect
        it. Now, each criterion is visible whether it is a match or not.
        
        <br /><br />
        <img src="../images/tut7_MatchAnalysesMatches.png" />
        <br /><br />
        
        Want more information about how a match is determined for a particular
        row? Click on a hyperlinked entry in the Name column and the associated
        documentation will be displayed (active internet connection required).
