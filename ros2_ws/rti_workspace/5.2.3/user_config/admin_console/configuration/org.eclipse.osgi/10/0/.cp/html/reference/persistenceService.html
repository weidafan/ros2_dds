		Persistence Service. To setup Persistence Service for Admin Console, verify administration and distributed logging is enabled in the Persistence service, 
		and also make sure the domain used by administration is joined by the Admin Console.
		
		See Persistence Service's user manual for details on how to enable Administration and Distributed Logging, and see <a href="../gettingstarted/setup.html"> Admin Console setup <a/> for details on how to join 
		addditional domains.
