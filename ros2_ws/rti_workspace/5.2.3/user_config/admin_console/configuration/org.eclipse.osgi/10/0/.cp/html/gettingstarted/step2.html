	<div class="docSectionContent">
		The System tree offers a hierarchical view of your distributed system.
		Expand the root System node and the node with the name of your host to
		see the list of running services. If there are warnings or errors
		associated with an entity, you will see the warning/error icon
		attached to the entity's icon. <br /> <br /> If you click on a node, a
		new tab with details about that entity will open in the main view.
