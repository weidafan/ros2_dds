Welcome to Connext.


Compiling this Example
----------------------
To build this example, open the appropriate solution file for your version of
Microsoft Visual Studio in the correct <win directory>. Where <win directory> 
is in the form win<32|64>-vs<version> depending on whether you are running 32 
or 64-bit and which Visual Studio version you are using. For example, if you 
are running 64-bit Visual Studio 2013 the directory is win64-vs2013. If you 
are using Visual Studio 2008 there will be no '-vs<version>' appended to the 
directory name. 


Running this Example
--------------------
To run this example, type the following in two different command shells,
either on the same machine or on different machines:

  > <win directory>\obj\<Debug|Release>\HelloSubscriber.exe
  > <win directory>\obj\<Debug|Release>\HelloPublisher.exe

Where <win directory> is described above. For example, if you are running the 
Debug 64-bit Visual Studio 2013 publisher the command is: 

   > win64-vs2013\obj\Debug\HelloPublisher.exe
