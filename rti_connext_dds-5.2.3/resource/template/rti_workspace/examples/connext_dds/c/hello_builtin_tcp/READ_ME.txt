====================================================
RTI Connext (formerly, RTI Data Distribution Service)
Hello_builtin Example Application with TCP Transport
====================================================

This example is a modified version of the hello_builtin example used in
the Connext Getting Started Guide. The original hello_builtin example 
was modified to disable the default transports (UDPv4 and Shared memory) 
and enable the TCP transport plugin using the programmatic API.

For an example of how to create a dynamic instance of the TCP transport
using the DDS Properties, see the example, helloWorldTCP.

The following files contain differences from the original hello_builtin:
    - make/Makefile.common
    - src/Hello.c

(You can 'diff' the various files to see the modifications and apply them
to any other application).


Purpose
=======

This example shows how to create an instance of the TCP transport 
plugin and tell Connext to use it as the only communication 
mechanism between peers.

For convenience, complete source code and a series of makefiles for
some architectures have been provided. Refer to the Getting Started 
Guide for additional information on the hello_builtin example.


How to Compile
==============

Before compiling make sure that the environment variable NDDSHOME is defined 
and that it refers to your RTI Connext installation directory. 

UNIX-based Systems
------------------

Because the example uses the Connext built-in types, there is no need 
to generate the type support code with rtiddsgen.

Before compiling, make sure that the desired version of compiler and 
linker are in your PATH environment variable.

To compile the example, just type:
    gmake -f make/Makefile.<architecture>
where <architecture> is your target architecture.

If you want to build a debug version of the example, use:
    gmake -f make/Makefile.<architecture> DEBUG=1

Refer to the file 'make/Makefile.common' for a list of options that 
can affect the build process.

If your architecture is not listed, you can add it by duplicating an 
existing one (the Makefile.xxxx) and changing the required flags.


Windows Systems
---------------

Open the Microsoft Developer Studio solution, win32/Hello-<arch>.sln
(where <arch> is one of the architectures supported), and simply build 
the project. 

Remember: The Visual C project uses the environment variable NDDSHOME to
locate the various libraries and include files. The NDDSHOME variable must
be set BEFORE opening Developer Studio.


How to Run
==========

1. To test a WAN scenario, you need to know the public IP address
   of each peer and have the firewall correctly configured. 
   Refer to the Connext User's Manual for more details.
   For a LAN scenario or to run the publisher and subscriber on the
   same machine, see next section.

2. On one machine, run the publisher:

   UNIX-based Systems:

   export NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS=tcpv4_wan://<subscriber_public_ip:port>
   ./objs/<arch>/Hello pub -a <public_ip:port> -p <bind_port>

   Windows Systems:

   set NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS=tcpv4_wan://<subscriber_public_ip:port>
   objs\<arch>\Hello pub -a <public_ip:port> -p <bind_port>

   Replace <subscriber_public_ip:port> with the public IP and port of
   the remote peer that will run the subscriber.

   Replace <public_ip:port> with your public IP and port that are
   exposed to the outside network.

   Replace <bind_port> with the port number on your local machine
   to listen for incoming connections.

   You can also optionally change the domain ID with the -d <domain>
   command-line option (default=0).

   See example below for a real scenario.

3. On another machine, run the subscriber:

   UNIX-based Systems

   export NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS=tcpv4_wan://<publisher_public_ip:port>
   ./objs/<arch>/Hello sub -a <public_ip:port> -p <bind_port>

   Windows Systems:

   set NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS=tcpv4_wan://<publisher_public_ip:port>
   objs\<arch>\Hello sub -a <public_ip:port> -p <bind_port>

   Similarly, <publisher_public_ip:port> is the public IP and port of
   the publisher.


As an example, consider the following configuration:

PUBLISHER:
                       +-------------+
    +-----+            | Router &    |
    | pub |------------| Firewall    |
    +-----+            |             | public ip: 99.88.77.66
   192.168.1.10:7400   +-------------+ fwd port: 5555

   - The publisher application is running on the machine 
     at 192.168.1.10
   - The publisher application is using as bind port: 7400
   - The router has port forward configured as:
        src port: 5555, destination: 192.168.1.10:7400
   - The public IP of this network is 99.88.77.66

SUBSCRIBER:
                       +-------------+
    +-----+            | Router &    |
    | sub |------------| Firewall    |
    +-----+            |             | public ip: 11.22.33.44
   192.168.5.20:7400   +-------------+ fwd port: 4444

   - The subscriber application is running on the machine 
     at 192.168.5.20
   - The subscriber application is using as bind port: 7400
   - The router has port forward configured as:
        src port: 4444, destination: 192.168.5.20:7400
   - The public IP of this network is 11.22.33.44

In this case, use the following commands to start the example:

PUBLISHER:
    export NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS=tcpv4_wan://11.22.33.44:4444
    ./Hello pub -a 99.88.77.66:5555 -p 7400

SUBSCRIBER:
    export NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS=tcpv4_wan://99.88.77.66:5555
    ./Hello sub -a 11.22.33.44:4444 -p 7400

Notes: 
    You do not need to set the environment variable 
    NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS on both publisher and subscriber; the
    discovery protocol will take care of propagating the public 
    location to the other node as soon as communication is established,
    but keep in mind that it take longer for discovery to
    complete this way.

    You CAN use a symbolic name instead of a numeric IP address 
    when you specify the NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS value, but you MUST use 
    a numeric IP address when you specify the public IP address of
    the network (the '-a' command-line option).


Running within a LAN
====================

When running within a LAN, you do not need to 
specify the '-a' parameter, as the transport will automatically use 
all the available network interface for communication.

Also, remember that the WAN and LAN have two different transport IDs, 
so when you specify the locators, you need to use 'tcpv4_lan' 
instead of 'tcpv4_wan.'

Even if the machines are within the same LAN, you can still use the
WAN transport ID, but you will need to specify the '-a' parameter.


Running on the same machine
===========================

When running on the same host, make sure you use different <bind_port> 
for your publisher and subscriber applications.

For example, to run the publisher and subscriber applications 
on the same machine using the LAN transport ID:

Publisher:
 UNIX-based Systems:
   export NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS=tcpv4_lan://localhost:7401
   ./Hello pub -p 7400

 Windows Systems:
   set NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS=tcpv4_lan://localhost:7401
   ./Hello pub -p 7400

Subscriber:
 UNIX-based Systems:
   export NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS=tcpv4_lan://localhost:7400
   ./Hello sub -p 7401

 Windows Systems:
   set NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS=tcpv4_lan://localhost:7400
   ./Hello sub -p 7401


Running with TLS enabled
========================

In order to use TCP transport with secure communication in Connext,
you will need to install the optional packages, RTI TLS
support, and the OpenSSL library.

In its simplest form, only two properties are required to enable TLS secure
communication between different peers:
    tls.verify.ca_file - the certificate file
    tls.identity.certificate_chain_file - the certificate chain file

The two parameters are required both to enable TLS.
In this example, you can set the two above parameters with the following two
command-line arguments:
    --tls-cert <ca_cert>
    --tls-chain <cert_chain>

For example:
    ./Hello pub -p 7400 --tls-cert ../../cacert.pem --tls-chain ../../peer1.pem  


When the two parameters are specified to valid files, the transport will
run using TLS enabled.

Example certificates for two peers are included in this example.

The internal behavior of the transport plugin will be exactly the same
as the case with security disabled, except that all the sockets used rely on
openssl for encryption.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. If you use TLS, you must set the transport's class ID to one of the following
   constants in your user application:
        NDDS_TRANSPORT_CLASSID_TLSV4_WAN
        NDDS_TRANSPORT_CLASSID_TLSV4_LAN

   This example application automatically sets this class ID for you
   based on the command line arguments.

2. Remember also that you MUST use the prefix 'tlsv4_lan://', or 'tlsv4_wan://' 
   instead of 'tcpv4_lan://' and 'tcpv4_wan://' when you define your initial 
   peer host. 

   ALSO NOTE THAT TCP AND TLS ARE NOT INTEROPERABLE!
   One peer implementing secure connection can never talk with another peer that
   uses the un-encrypted TCP connection.

3. In order to break the dependency between the TCP transport library and the 
   OpenSSL library, when TLS security is enabled, the transport will \
   dynamically load the following library:
        Unix:   libnddstls.so (release version)
                libnddstlsd.so (debug version)
        Windows:nddstls.dll (release version)
                nddstlsd.dll (debug version)
   
   The NDDSTLS Library will then dynamically load the OpenSSL during its
   initialization.

   In conclusion, ONLY WHEN TLS IS ENABLED:
        - TCP transport library will dynamically load the NDDS TLS library
        - NDDS TLS library will dynamically load the OpenSSL library

   YOU MUST ENSURE THAT THE ABOVE LIBRARIES ARE PRESENT IN YOUR SEARCH PATH 
   BEFORE STARTING YOUR APPLICATION (if your application enables TLS!).
   This requirement is not needed if your application does not use TLS.

4. In symmetric communication scenarios, any Connext
   application can initiate TCP connections with other applications.

   In asymmetric communication scenarios, TCP connections can be
   initiated only by one Connext instance. For
   security reasons, any incoming connection from the other instance is
   not allowed.

   By running the example as stated above with TLS enabled, it is runing in
   symmetric mode.

   To run in asymmetric mode, leave the NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS unset on
   the server side, and not provide the "-a" and "-p" command line
   arguments on the client side (because the client side has no publicly
   reachable address:port).
